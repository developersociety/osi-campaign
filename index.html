            <h4>Community Quotes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"If the highly accessible, transparent, open, and earnest nature of the people in our community is anything to go by, there are plenty of reasons to think that we've not only got a great community undergirding the movement, but also plenty of reasons to simply be hopeful for what the future might bring. I think that everyone can have a role to play in giving life to the activism of the open source community -- the OSI is a great place to do just that." <span>Vladimir Bejdo</span></li>
                <li>"The Open Source Initiative means, to me, the guardian of the letter and the spirit of open source. A lot of business value is built on open source software, and yet not that many companies sponsor the OSI. A lot of individual careers have been built on open source, and yet not that many people are OSI members. Funding the OSI ensures that it can continue that important work, and can tackle future challenges and threats." <span>Thierry Carrez, OSI Board Director, VP of Engineering - Open Infrastructure Foundation</span></li>
                <li>"OSI has been quietly important to the success of the Open Source model for two decades. Beyond just licensing, it [OSI] effectively challenges abuse while planting seeds of advocacy globally across communities and industries. Supporting OSI means continuing and growing this approach to undramatic but effective stewardship of open source." <span>Simon Phipps, Meshed Insights Ltd</span></li>
                <li>"Over the past 20+ years, open source has – often invisibly – helped shape our digital world. It has enabled business collaboration on technologies that are foundational to society, empowered individuals with rights to the software we use every day, and elevated countless contributors' careers. OSI's stewardship of the legal instruments, which underpin all open source software, helps make this possible. I encourage you to support the OSI's growth so it may continue to raise awareness of the mission and tackle emerging challenges to the use of open source."      - <span>Aeva Black, Open Source Hacker, Azure Office of the CTO</span></li>
                <li>"I believe that a healthy and sustaining open source ecosystem is vital to improving our forever growing vast digital world. As a member of OSI, I support and contribute to the organization championing the roles of educator and advocate around the policies and principles of open source–we impact the intention and execution with which all open source is built. Partnering with OSI by sponsoring our work is an investment in strengthening the collaborative threads of open communities and individuals, through pragmatic education and advocacy of open source policies and principles. It is an investment in the future of a thriving open source ecosystem." <span>Tracy Hinds, OSI Board Director</span></li>
                <li>"I'm proud to be an OSI member because as more and more folks become users and participants in the open source software community, we need the OSI to maintain a clear line on what open source means and to hold a space for practitioners to share their knowledge with each other." <span>Deb Nicholson, Former OSI General Manager</span></li>
                <li>"The OSI does foundational work in reviewing and approving open source licenses, which are licenses that assure that software can be freely used and shared by both individuals and commercial, educational, government and nonprofit entities without any royalty obligations. The software industry would not be where it is today without the OSI's important work in assuring that the licenses that it approves deliver on the promise of open source." - <span>Pamela S. Chestek, OSI Board Director & License Committee Chair</span></li>
                <li>“I decided to join OSI as a member because I am strongly convinced that open source software needs a stronger independent representation, which is leveraging OSS strengths to grow the community and the industry, and at the same time is educating individuals and enterprises about the unique advantages of free software.” <span>Italo Vignoli - OSI Board Director</span></li>
                <li>I see open source as a solution for sustainability development. We need a complete shift of paradigm from a closed proprietary competition mindset to an open and collaborative way of solving the global issues. I call for individuals to support and participate in the open source movement. Only by working together can we make bigger strides in solving the world’s most pressing problems.” <span>Hong Phuc Dang, Founder, FOSSASIA</span></li>
